# Sparse Horseshoe Estimation via Expectation-Maximisation

We propose a novel expectation-maximization (EM) procedure for computing the MAP estimates of the parameters in the case of the standard linear model. A particular strength of our 
approach is that the M-step depends only on the form of the prior and it is independent of the form of the likelihood. We introduce several simple modifications of this EM procedure that allow for straightforward extension to generalized linear models
